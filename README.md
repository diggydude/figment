# figment

Figment is a PHP open source platform for building your own private social networking site.

If you would like to join this project, please e-mail James at therealdiggydude (at) gmail (dot) com.

Figment is designed to run on most personal Web hosting servers. As such, it leverages features that
are likely to be bundled with PHP by default. However, some free third-party packages are required
for best results.

Requirements:

* A domain name and Web hosting account.
* PHP 5.3 or higher.
* A MySQL or MariaDB database account.
* GeSHi Generic Syntax Highlighter (http://qbnz.com/highlighter/)
