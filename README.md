# figment

Figment is an open source PHP platform for building your own private social networking site.

If you would like to join this project, please e-mail James at therealdiggydude (at) gmail (dot) com.

Figment is designed to run on most personal Web hosting servers. As such, it leverages features that
are likely to be bundled with PHP by default. However, some additional free third-party packages are
required for best results.

Requirements:

* A domain name and Web hosting account.
* PHP 5.3 or higher.
* A MariaDB (preferred) or MySQL database account.
* A Memcached server. (Ask your hosting provider.)
* GeSHi Generic Syntax Highlighter (http://qbnz.com/highlighter/)
* jQuery (http://jquery.com/)
