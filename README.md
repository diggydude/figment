# figment

Figment is an open source PHP platform for building your own private social networking site.

If you would like to join this project, please e-mail James at therealdiggydude (at) gmail (dot) com.

Figment is designed to run on most personal Web hosting servers. As such, it leverages features that
are likely to be bundled with PHP by default. However, some additional free third-party packages are
required for best results.

Requirements:

* A domain name and Web hosting account.
* PHP 5.3 or higher.
* A MariaDB (preferred) or MySQL database account.
* A Memcached server. (Ask your hosting provider.)
* GeSHi Generic Syntax Highlighter (http://qbnz.com/highlighter/)
* jQuery (http://jquery.com/)

In addition, you'll need a text editor and an FTP client to perform a few initial setup tasks. Some
commerical text editors, such as UltraEdit (https://www.ultraedit.com/, 30 day free trial) allow you
to open files directly from, and save them directly to, the FTP server. Alternately, you can use a
separate text editor such as Notepad and a free FTP client such as Filezilla (https://filezilla-project.org/).

If you're a developer and wish to modify the Figment database for your own purposes, you'll need
a database administration tool such as phpMyAdmin (https://www.phpmyadmin.net/). Note that the Figment
authors cannot provide any support if you modify the datbase schema or SQL queries!
